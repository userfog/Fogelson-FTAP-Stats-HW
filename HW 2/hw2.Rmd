This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(gdata)
library(plyr)
countries <- read.xls(xls = "country portfolios.xlsx", sheet = 1)
countries <- rename(x = countries, c("Global.Index.Key...Index.Monthly"="key", "Index.Price...Close.Monthly"="price", "Data.Date...Index.Monthly"="date", "Index.Name"="name"))

indexReturns <- data.frame(seq(1:184))

for(i in unique(countries$name)){
  
  considering <- countries[countries["name"] == i,]
  diff <- considering$price[-1] - considering$price[-length(considering$price)]
  basicReturn <- diff / considering$price[-length(considering$price)]
  indexReturns <- cbind(indexReturns, basicReturn)
  indexReturns <- rename(x = indexReturns, c("basicReturn"=i))
}

drops <- c("seq.1.184.")
indexReturns <- indexReturns[, !(names(indexReturns) %in% drops)]

varCov <- var(indexReturns, y=indexReturns)
corMat <- cor(indexReturns, indexReturns)


# The correlation matrix contains more interpretable information regarding the degree of 
# co-movement in each pair of series because it is normalized based on the standard deviations

for(i in unique(countries$names)){
  barplot(corMat[,i], las=2, cex.names = .9)
}
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
